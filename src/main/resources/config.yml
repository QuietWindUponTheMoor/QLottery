# Set the interval for which the lottery is drawn, in seconds. 120 = 2 minutes.
draw-interval: 120

# Set the draw multiplier (0-1). This number is the number the total pool amount is multiplied by and added to the pool upon cashout.
# For example, if the pool amount is $1,000.00 and the multiplier is set to 0.5, the total cashout will be $1,500.00
# For a balanced lottery system, we don't recommend that this value gets set higher than 0.15. The default value is 0.1
# Set this to 0 to make cashouts be exactly the starting-amount + player pool.
# The max multiplier is 1.0
# Set this to between 0.1 and 1.0
draw-multiplier: 0.1

# Set the starting amount that the pool will start with.
# This is the amount of money that will start off in the pool and then get added to by player ticket sales and pool additions.
# Players can add to the pool a specific amount by using /ql pool add <amount>
# The default amount is $1,000.00 (value of 1000)
# Set this to 0 to have a starting pool of $0
pool-default-amount: 1000.00

# The cost of a lottery ticket
ticket-cost: 20.00

# The max amount of tickets a player can buy at once
max-tickets: 20

# The percent at which the 2nd place and 3rd place winners for normal payouts gets.
# For example, if the total pool size is $1,000.00 and this number is set to 0.5, this winner will get $500
# The default for 2nd place is 0.25
second-place-multiplier: 0.25
# The default for 3rd place is 0.10
third-place-multiplier: 0.10

# To make it possible for there to not always be winners, this is the multiplier by which to multiply the total purchased tickets amount by.
# For example, if there have been 100 tickets purchased, and this number is set to 0.3, then the lottery will insert 30 arbitrary tickets into the pool.
# These 'arbitrary' tickets are useless and only serve as padding. The system may draw one of these tickets, and if it does, the draw timer will restart and the current pool will be added to the next pool.
# The default is 0.45
# The result of totalCurrentTickets and this value will be rounded UP.
arbitrary-tickets-multiplier: 0.45

# Set the tax percent that winners are taxed upon payout
# This value should be between 0 and 1
# The default tax is 6% (0.06)
payout-tax: 0.06

# This is the amount of money the bonus winner gets.
# This number is meant to be much lower than a normal prize, say $100, which is the default value here.
# This amount is not taxed
bonus-winner-amount: 100.00

# The max amount of money the pool can accrue, if there was not a winner.
# The default is 10000.00 ($10,000.00)
# Set this to -1.00 if you want to remove the limit
pool-accrue-limit: 10000.00
